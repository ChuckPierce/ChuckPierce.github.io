My name is Chuck Pierce. I'm a Fullstack Web Developer living in New York City.  I recently completed an immersive web development course at Fullstack Academy of Code where I learned the MEAN stack of technologies (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js).  In the past, I also worked in the media industry at places like Fox News Radio, Meetinghouse Productions, Juma Entertainment, and Comtex News Network.  I also received two bachelor's degrees from the Pennsylvania State University in English and Broadcast Journalism.  I am currently looking for a place to hone my web development skills so please email me at chuckmpierce@gmail.com for leads and offers.<br>

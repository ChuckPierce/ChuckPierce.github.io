My name is Chuck Pierce. I'm a Fullstack Web Developer living in New York City.  I currently work as a Frontend Engineer for Percolate Inc., an enterprise marketing software company. Before my employment there, I completed an immersive web development course at Fullstack Academy of Code where I learned the MEAN stack of technologies (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js).  In the past, I also worked in the media industry at places like Fox News Radio, Meetinghouse Productions, Juma Entertainment, and Comtex News Network.  I also received two bachelor's degrees from the Pennsylvania State University in English and Broadcast Journalism.<br>

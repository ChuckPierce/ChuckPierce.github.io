    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Through the weeks leading up to my first day at FullStack Academy of Code, I was assigned to create a simple web guessing game with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
<p><a href="/Guessing-Game">The Guessing Game</a></p>
<p>My inspiration for the design of the game came from a early 20th century newspaper.  With that in mind I decided to create a little mascot for the game. For the purposes of the post let’s call him Harrison. </p>
<p><img src="/Guessing-Game/littleguy.png"></p>
<p>Harrison is displayed in the beginning of the game as his normal self.  As the player puts guesses into the game, the image changes based on how hot or cold the player is.  I used classes in CSS to achieve this change.  Based on how close the guess is to the number determines what the image will be and what clue the player will be given to help them get to the final number.  The player only has five guesses and Harrison will either die (a little x over the eyes image) or he will give you a thumbs up.  Then the game can be played again with the reset button.</p>
<p>There are a few more things I can do to make the code DRY but I think I completed the basics of what I wanted to accomplish.  Feel free to try the game in the link above!</p>
<p>Check back here for more of my progress at FullStack and my journey in development.  Happy coding!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When trying to find the idea for my first post on this blog I cam across the perfect title: <a href="http://chuckpierce.github.io" target="_blank" rel="external">My Life In Development</a></p>
<p>I believe I’m constantly developing as I journey through life. There are always changes, always new experiences that I’m taking part in whether it be a new job, a new city, a new hobby, or a new relationship. As these changes occur, my decision on what I want to do in this world changes with it. And even though my trajectory continues to shift, my goal remains the same. I want to <i>learn</i> and I want to <i>create</i>.</p>
<p>This goal first manifested itself when I first learned how to read. I became fascinated with books and how they took me to far away lands and epic tales right inside my own imagination. That led me to create stories of my own, imagining characters, conflicts and whole new worlds. Eventually I started writing these ideas down, drawing them on notebook paper, and acting them out in my backyard. I then wanted to learn all I could as I went through school because I found the more knowledge that I gained, the easier it was to create new and interesting things. As I went through school, I made sure that I continued these creative outlets by doing things like writing short stories, playing music, and acting in theatre. As long as I was creating, I was happy.</p>
<p>But, there was something else that caught my attention while in school. The World Wide Web was becoming bigger and bigger and I saw that people were actually creating on the web for everyone to see. I wanted to be a part of that, even if I only had one website. So, before CSS was widely being used I learned HTML on my own with my best friend and we made a website. It look a long time. Long hours on the weekend creating graphics, new pages and links, using tables for aligning content, and even using pre-coded javascript to make our site a little more dynamic. I would show you that site (it is still being hosted on a free service believe it or not) but I think it would be a little too embarrassing.</p>
<p>From there I always had a fascination with creating on the web. In college, I designed and maintained two different club websites just in my spare time and even took some classes on the side. But, I never considered it as a career. I just thought of it as another tool in my tool belt to hopefully lead me to a writing job for the web or even web journalism.</p>
<p>I did end up using a lot of those skills in various jobs but as a used them more and more I always wondered why I wasn’t trying to do this as a career. And, although making applications is a little more complicated than designing websites, I thought I would find it interesting to create not just the look of a web site but what a web site could do.</p>
<p>That’s why I’m at the point I’m at now and that’s why “My Life in Development” is such an appropriate name. I am finding my way and I think now that path is clear.</p>
